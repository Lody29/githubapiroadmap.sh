The question is to build a simple cli to get the recent changes from a users account on gihub;
he project Url: https://roadmap.sh/projects/github-user-activity
It was obtained from roadmap.sh beginner projects

the project Url: https://roadmap.sh/projects/github-user-activity



It requires json imported and requests to be installed
 This is a simple cli application that uses the github api 
It is built in python
It asks for the user's username
It pastes the username on the path to find the users account
then it dumps all the data onto the events.json file
it handles errors such as 401 404 and unauthorized access
